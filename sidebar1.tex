\cvsection{Profile}

I am a passionate life-long student, with interests primarily in mathematical physics. My long-term dream is to pursue scientific research and lecture my field.

\medskip

I love learning new skills, collaborating and sharing my knowledge with others. I am especially passionate about teaching, which I view both as an honour and a moral imperative. My knowledge and skills are products of a good deal of privilege, and it is by teaching a broad audience that I strive to pay this back.

\medskip

\cvsubsection{Hobbies}
I enjoy reading, trail-running, cooking, mushroom-hunting, and tabletop games, especially the abstract strategy game

\cvsubsection{Citizenship}
I am a dual citizen of South Africa and Italy.
