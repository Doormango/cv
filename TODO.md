# TODO

What follows is a list of CV edits yet to be applied. This is entirely for my own sake.

## Essential changes

- Add section for Outreach; incl Sat School teaching & NITheCS online math
	- 14/10/2023: joined NITheCS math lesson as panelist (get YT link)

## Possible changes

- Add philosophy and/or other side reading to CV, maybe in bio / Personal Projects
- Add Hive web project to Personal Projects
