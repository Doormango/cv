# TODO

What follows is a list of CV edits yet to be applied. This is entirely for my own sake.

## Essential changes

- Add GitHub action to compile & commit to website repo
- Add section for Outreach; incl Sat School teaching & NITheCS online math

## Possible changes

- Modify above GitHub action to also commit image preview (generated using `pdftoppm`);
  reference this preview in the cv repo README.md
- Add philosophy and/or other side reading to CV, maybe in bio / Personal Projects
- Add Hive web project to Personal Projects
